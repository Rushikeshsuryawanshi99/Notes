What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a DevOps software development practice that enables the developers 
to merge their code changes in the central repository. That way, automated builds and tests can be run.
The amendments by the developers are validated by creating a built and running an automated test against them. 
In the case of Continuous Integration, a tremendous amount of emphasis is placed on testing automation to 
check on the application. This is to know if it is broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.

What is Continuous Delivery?

Continuous Delivery (CD) is a DevOps practice that refers to the building, testing, and delivering improvements
to the software code. The phase is referred to as the extension of the Continuous Integration phase to make sure
that new changes can be released to the customers quickly in a substantial manner. 

This can be simplified as, though you have automated testing, the release process is also automated, and any 
deployment can occur at any time with just one click of a button.

Continuous Delivery gives you the power to decide whether to make the releases daily, weekly,
or whenever the business requires it. The maximum benefits of Continuous Delivery can only be yielded 
if they release small batches, which are easy to troubleshoot if any glitch occurs.
