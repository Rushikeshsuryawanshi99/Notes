What is Git?
git is an open source vcs that allows the user to keep track 
of all the changes that have been made to the source code of the software.
(also called vcs- version control system) Global information tracker (Git) 
introduced in 2005
vcs examples :- code commit, git, mercurial
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. 
It is a free and open-source version control system used
to handle small to very large projects efficiently.
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling
multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

why we need git ?
One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities.
Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap
and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular
with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment
for every change to your codebase.

git init >it will initiate empty git repo to that particular dir or folder
.git dir will made 
git status > information about branch how many commits you made how many tracked or untracked files are done 
git status commnd should be run inside the initilised folder only

git checkout -b master it will switched to master branch 
branch :- A branch represents an independent line of development.
Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory,
staging area, and project history.
