What is Git? (also called vcs- version control system) Global information tracker (Git) 
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management.

why we need git ?
One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities.
Unlike centralized version control systems, Git branches are cheap
and easy to merge. This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular
with many Git users. Feature branches provide an isolated environment
for every change to your codebase.
